## Hi!, I‚Äôm Owen Hernandez Fino, a 17-year-old Mechatronics Engineering student from St John Paul College II. I‚Äôve studied Mechatronics and C++ programming for the past two years as part of my senior college program, and was honored as the Top Mechatronics Student in Semester One of my course. <br/>

üîß I'm experienced in working with a wide range of microcontrollers including various models of Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico, and I‚Äôm currently expanding my skills in STM32 and Embedded C for more advanced, real-time applications. <br/>

üåç In 2025, I was selected to attend the London International Youth Science Movement (LIYSM), an experience that deepened my passion for global innovation and research. <br/>

ü§ù I love collaborating with students and professionals from other engineering disciplines, as it constantly broadens my perspective and sharpens my approach to problem-solving. <br/>
