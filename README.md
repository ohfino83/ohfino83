## Hi!, I‚Äôm Owen Hernandez Fino, a 17-year-old Mechatronics Engineering student from St John Paul College II. I‚Äôve studied Mechatronics and C++ programming for the past two years as part of my senior college program, and was honored as the Top Mechatronics Student in Semester One of my course. <br/>

üîß I'm experienced in working with a wide range of microcontrollers including various models of Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico, and I‚Äôm currently expanding my skills in STM32 and Embedded C for more advanced, real-time applications. <br/>

üåç In 2025, I was selected to attend the London International Youth Science Forum 2025 (LIYSF), an experience that deepened my passion for global innovation and research, which as been blogged and documented on my Youtube Channek. <br/>

ü§ù I love collaborating with students and professionals from other engineering disciplines, as it constantly broadens my perspective and sharpens my approach to problem-solving. <br/>
